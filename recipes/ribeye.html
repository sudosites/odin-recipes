    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Salting the ribeye steak two days prior to cooking brines the steak, helps tenderize it, and adds rich flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 (8 ounce) ribeye steaks</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h5>Step 1</h5>
    <p>Salt both sides of steaks with 1/2 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt per steak. Place steaks in an airtight container and refrigerate 48 hours.</p>
    <h5>Step 2</h5>
    <p>Remove steaks from the refrigerator about 30 minutes prior to cooking. Sprinkle both sides of steaks with black pepper. </p>
    <h5>Step 3</h5>
    <p>Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until very hot. Add vegetable oil; heat until oil shimmers. </p>
    <h5>Step 4</h5>
    <p>Carefully place steaks in skillet. Cook until brown and hard-seared on one side, 4 to 5 minutes. </p>
    <h5>Step 5</h5>
    <p>Flip steaks; top with 1 teaspoon butter. Cook until desired doneness, or 3 to 4 minutes more. You may need to cook steaks in batches depending on the size of your cast-iron skillet. Keep cooked steaks in a 170 degrees F ( 77 degrees C) oven until ready to serve.</p>
